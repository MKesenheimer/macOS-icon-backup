# macOS-icon-backup
Backup your application icons before it is too late!

With Apple rolling out a new macOS update, many program icons will be changed to match the look of iOS App icons.
Since I am using older applications which I expect will not get a new icon, I have the "issue" that the style of the icons do not match.
Additionaly, I don't like the style of the new icon layout, which is why I wrote this script to backup all the old icons of all my programs.
If a program gets a new icon that I don't like, I can simply pull out the app icon before the update und change it back.

Hope this is helpful for someone else, too.
